<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to all IslandWave services provided anywhere in Canada. By ordering, using, or paying for the Services, you agree to these Terms.</p>
<h3>1) Service Availability & Installation</h3>
<p>Service availability depends on network access in your area. Installation may include inside wiring, equipment placement, and activation. You grant permission to access your premises for installation, maintenance, or removal. We may use third‑party contractors.</p>
<h3>2) Plans, Speeds & Performance</h3>
<p>Advertised speeds are maximum theoretical rates. Actual speeds may vary due to network conditions, your equipment, traffic management, and location. We may use reasonable network management practices to maintain service quality.</p>
<h3>3) Billing & Payment</h3>
<p>Services are billed in Canadian dollars (CAD) on a monthly basis in advance. Taxes and government fees apply. Late or returned payments may incur administrative fees. Non‑payment may result in suspension or termination. You are responsible for all usage on your account.</p>
<h3>4) Equipment</h3>
<p>Some equipment is rented and must be returned in good condition upon cancellation; non‑returned or damaged equipment may be charged at replacement value. Customer‑owned equipment must meet our technical requirements.</p>
<h3>5) Acceptable Use</h3>
<p>You must comply with the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Prohibited activities include unlawful content or use, spam, network abuse, security breaches, and copyright infringement.</p>
<h3>6) Privacy</h3>
<p>We handle personal information in accordance with Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and any applicable provincial privacy laws. See our Privacy Policy for details.</p>
<h3>7) Service Changes</h3>
<p>We may modify plans, features, or pricing with notice as required by law. If changes materially disadvantage you, you may cancel without early termination fees (if any) as permitted by applicable consumer protection laws.</p>
<h3>8) Liability & Disclaimers</h3>
<p>The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” We are not liable for interruptions or data loss caused by events beyond our reasonable control. Our total liability is limited to fees paid by you for the affected Service during the month in which the claim arose, unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<h3>9) Termination</h3>
<p>You may cancel at any time by providing notice. We may suspend or terminate for non‑payment, breach of these Terms or the AUP, or to protect the network. Upon termination, outstanding amounts become due immediately.</p>
<h3>10) Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the province or territory in which you primarily receive the Services and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. Consumers may also pursue remedies through the CCTS (Commission for Complaints for Telecom‑television Services) where applicable.</p>
